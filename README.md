## HoneyBee

MediaWiki extension to connect a wiki to WikiApiary for a variety of features.

#### Background

HoneyBee is starting as an empty repository. The goal is to allow other developers who would like to help [WikiApiary](http://wikiapiary.com/) move forward an opportunity to contribute to the project. The [WikiApiary Bots](https://github.com/thingles/WikiApiary/) are open source already, but for a long time I've wanted an extension for WikiApiary, thus BumbleBee.

Please fork this repository, take a look at identified issues, and then send a pull request when ready. All contributions are welcome! Thank you!
